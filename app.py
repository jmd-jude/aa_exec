    Audience Acuity, the leading identity resolution provider, today announced the launch of Conversational Identity Intelligence, a transformative addition to its Super Identity Graph (SIG) that enables marketers and business strategists to interact with complex identity data through natural language. This industry-first capability eliminates the technical barriers that have traditionally limited identity data insights to SQL-proficient analysts, democratizing access to the company's industry-leading identity resolution platform.
